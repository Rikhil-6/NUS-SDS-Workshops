# Data Visualization With Python Workshop

Hello all and welcome to our Data Viz w Python Workshop! Please download the entire Data Vizualisation with Python Github Repository onto your local computer (you can [click on the link here](https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FRikhil-6%2FNUS-SDS-Workshops%2Ftree%2Fmain%2FAY%252024-25%2520Sem%25201%2FData%2520Visualization%2520with%2520Python) to accomplish this)
You may then extract this folder onto any directory in your computer and run the code after ensuring the following steps have been met.

## Requirements
As our Workshop will involve a Code-Along; it is recommended to have an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like PyCharm/ VSCode installed and configured on your laptop. You will also have to check that the necessary libraries in the requirements.txt file have been installed. If you are unsure if this is the case; you may install those libraries by running the ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` command in your terminal/ command prompt.

## Dataset
The external Dataset that will be primarily used alongside this code is the "Cars_below_50k_v2_11-12-2023.xlsx" Excel file. Ensure that this file is located in the same folder as the code and the requirements.txt file.

## Code
The Code is setup in a jupyter notebook (.ipynb) file that is pragmatic to run in Data Science and Analysis (DSA) Applications. It allows for segments of code to be run individually and also supports Markdowns and Images in alongside code blocks. As the syntax is primarily similar to standard CPython files and it can be run by most IDEs that can run python files - unfamiliarity with Jupyter Notebooks is not something to be overly concerned with for the Workshop. 

Should you have any queries apart from those mentioned above, do feel free to raise them during the Workshop segment. Thank you and happy coding!
