# All About Trees

Hello all and welcome to our All About Trees Workshop! 

For the code along, we encourage you to use Google Colab for this workshop, to avoid problems with downloads on your computer. Access it with [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18df908RvAFa9oUjyDIOKBpCbDu2rkzgE?usp=sharing)

Alternatively, if you have some coding experience and would like to run the code along locally, please use this [link here](https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https://github.com/Rikhil-6/NUS-SDS-Workshops/tree/main/AY%2024-25%20Sem%201/All%20about%20Trees) to download the materials folder from Github. You may then extract this folder onto any directory in your computer and run the code after ensuring the following steps have been met.

## Requirements (for running locally)

As our Workshop will involve a Code-Along; it is recommended to have an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like PyCharm/ VSCode installed and configured on your laptop. As this Workshop involves Python - it is also necessary to have a version of Python greater than Python 3.8 installed on your device. 

## Code and Dataset

The external Dataset that will be primarily used alongside this code is the "diabetes_binary_5050split.csv" file. Ensure that this file is located in the same folder as the code notebook. The code for the code along session are in the "Trees_workshop_Code_Along.ipynb" file.

Should you have any queries apart from those mentioned above, do feel free to raise them before/during the Workshop segment. Thank you and happy coding!
