## Data Engineering and GenAI Workshop
Hello all and welcome to our Data Engineering Workshop!

**Datasets and Code**
For the code along, we encourage you to download this repository onto your local computer and follow the instructions in the Workshop itself. You may click this [hyperlinked text here](https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FRikhil-6%2FNUS-SDS-Workshops%2Ftree%2Fmain%2FAY24-25%2FSDS_Data%2520Engineering_AI) to download this repository locally.
Please note that the files ending with the suffix `_workshop` are those that you should access for the Code-Along, while those ending with the suffix `_reference` are meant for referral should you need assistance at any point in time.  

**Requirements**
As our Workshop will have Code-Along segments; it is recommended to have an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like PyCharm/ VSCode installed and configured on your laptop. 
Owing to the use of Python - it is also necessary to have a version of Python greater than Python 3.8 installed on your device. We also employ a number of libraries which you may not have downloaded previously - fear not because
you may simply run the `pip install -r path/to/requirements.txt` command in your terminal (amending the `path/to/requirements.txt` path as need be)


Should you have any queries apart from those mentioned above, do feel free to raise them before/during the Workshop segment. 
Thank you and happy coding!
