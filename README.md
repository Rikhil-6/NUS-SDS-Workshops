# NUS-SDS-Workshops
The Main Repository for all code related to NUS SDS Workshops's Committee

**Hello Everyone!**

Welcome to the Consolidated Repository for SDS's Workshops Code! In this repository you will have access to subfolders showcasing the various datasets and files containing code which you are encouraged to engage in as a Workshop is conducted! 

We hope that this consolidated repository provides an easily accessible point for everyone interested in signing up for an SDS Workshop to code along and learn new skills that can prove beneficial for them in the future!
